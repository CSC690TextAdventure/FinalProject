# Story Idea

    Escape from the SFSU Library!
    You wake up from a night of study in the basement of the library. 
    The library closes for the holidays, but you're still trapped inside!  
    Discover ways to unlock doors, turn on elevators, and more. 
    As you open up more pathways in the library, a dark conspiracy reveals itself...
